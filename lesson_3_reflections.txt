Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I don't need for Git to pull changes at will because i may not want the remote changes 
	added to my local master, i may even want to organize those changes into another branch.
	The current setup gives me the ability to manage the use of all changes to very 
	sensitive working materials.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branches are new directions you want you file tree to go in in order to make changes  
	that wont affect the main tree line until you are ready for those changes to take 
	effect (if ever).  A clone is a copy of a gitHub remote. added to your local computer.
	a fork is a gitHub clone that is added to your gitHub remote account and not your local  
	computer that is directly related to the original remote still on gitHub.  I know we  
	can still upload a clone to our remote which will be like a clone exising on our gitHub  
	remote account but its different.  I don't think it has the same origin? or links to  
	the original file anymore as a pushed commit of a clone to a new remote repository  
	instead of a cloned fork.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	the benefit of having the last known state stored locally is the only way to keep track 
	of how far behind or in front of the remote your current state is.  It can also tell you 
	when the state of the remote and your current state have diverged. if you didnt' have 
	this record there would be not way of knowing and you would create merges into chaos.
