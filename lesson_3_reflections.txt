Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I don't need for Git to pull changes at will because i may not want the remote changes 
	added to my local master, i may even want to organize those changes into another branch.
	The current setup gives me the ability to manage the use of all changes to very 
	sensitive working materials.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branches are new directions you want you file tree to go in in order to make changes  
	that wont affect the main tree line until you are ready for those changes to take 
	effect (if ever).  A clone is a copy of a gitHub remote. added to your local computer.
	a fork is a gitHub clone that is added to your gitHub remote account and not your local  
	computer that is directly related to the original remote still on gitHub.  I know we  
	can still upload a clone to our remote which will be like a clone exising on our gitHub  
	remote account but its different.  I don't think it has the same origin? or links to  
	the original file anymore as a pushed commit of a clone to a new remote repository  
	instead of a cloned fork.
