How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

		the staging area is different from the working directory because it holds the value
		of the last commit while you change the staging area.  when you run git status it
		is able to tell you that you have made changes in the working directory.
		
		the staging area is different from the repository because it holds changes you have made to the working directory once you have added the file to the staging area to be reviewed to be committed. it allows you an additional step of review before actually committing to a commit.
